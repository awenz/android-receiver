# Android Receiver

Listen for broadcast messages from 
[android-notifer](http://code.google.com/p/android-notifier/) coming 
over a specific port.

Format that message (todo) and pass it off to a handling application 
like notify-osd, dzen2, or some other script.

Done mostly as a learning exercise in C.
